Testing scenerios
1.  data will be sorted according to sortValue. 
    if sortValue contains more than 1 value then firstly it will be sorted by 1st value and then by 2nd value.
2.  Top rankers with asc usercount -  sortValue: ['rank', 'usercount'],
    if you want to sort one column in asc and next column in desc then put '-' (negetive sign) in the required column
    e.g. -  Top rankers with desc usercount -  sortValue: ['rank', '-usercount']
            rank will be sorted in asc, but usercount will be sorted in desc order.
